            <h5>What is the use of Web Scraper?</h5>
            <p>
                Web scraping extracts large amounts of unstructured website data (HTML) from websites and converts it into a structured format (Excel, CSV, JSON, etc.) for easier analysis and processing. It is widely used for various purposes such as market research, price comparison, sentiment analysis, lead generation, and more.

            <p>
                This MVP enables screenshot capture and text extraction from web pages. To avoid rate limiting, a game lets users earn coins which they spend on scraping features.

            <p>But to use this, I've developed a clicker game that allows users to get coins and then spend them on using the features of the web scraper.<br />This step is taken to avoid rate limiting issues if users try to mass scrape pages.</p>
