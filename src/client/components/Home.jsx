            <h5>What is the use of Web Scraper?</h5>
            <p>
                Web scraping is a technique used to extract large amounts of data from websites where the data is unstructured (HTML format) and convert it into a structured format (Excel, CSV, JSON, etc.) for easier analysis and processing. It is commonly used for various purposes such as market research, price comparison, sentiment analysis, lead generation, and more.
